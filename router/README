=============
 Compilation
=============
Untar the source code.
% tar -zxvf ISPD2008-NTHU-R-CodeRelease.tar.gz

Change the working directory into src.
% cd ISPD2008-NTHU-R-CodeRelease/src

Use make command to compile the source code.
% make clean all

If no error occurs during compilation, the executable router will be in 
ISPD2008-NTHU-R-CodeRelease/bin directory.
